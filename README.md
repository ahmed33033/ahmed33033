## Hi.

hold on i think that's a little too formal

## Hi there! 👋

now it just looks like chatgpt, wait

## Hey!

My name is Ahmed Mohamed. Good meeting you!

I am a student at UofT majoring in Computer Science & Sociology (weird mix i know).

I like writing code and actually writing stuff.

Currently, I'm interested in full-stack applications powered with AI (the gpt kind). If you're the same, let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmeddamohamed/).

Finally, check out my most recent contributions and pinned repositories for intersting bits!
